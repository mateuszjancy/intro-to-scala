/**
 * Write a function that, given a string, produces a map of the indexes of all characters.
 * For example indexes("Mississippi") should return a map associating 'M' with the set {0},
 * 'i' with the set{1, 4, 7, 10} and so on. Use a mutable map of characters to mutable sets.
 * How can you ensure that the set is sorted?
